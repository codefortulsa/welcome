## Looking for Help?

If you have an idea you'd like to pitch to our group, a great place to get the dialogue started is in our mailing list:

1. Introduce yourself! Tell us who you are and what organization you're involved with.

2. Tell us about a project you'd like to see happen:

  * Who are the users of the solution you're looking for?
  * What is the problem you're trying to solve for your users?
  * What, if any, data or information do you need to solve this problem?
  
## Looking to start helping?

  * Check out the list of [projects](https://github.com/codefortulsa/welcome/blob/master/projects.md) that we are working on. If any spark your interest, reach out to the tech lead or product lead for that project.
